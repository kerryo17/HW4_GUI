I used bootstrap to implement a few different things. I used bootstrap to create a responsive header, columns, nav bar, and photo gallery. I also used bootstrap buttons to 
link my homeworks in a more organized matter. The biggest difference I would say is the whole layout of my website. I used the column and grid system in the bootstrap library, 
and my new website is a lot more cleaner. In my old website, I hard coded the location of everything, so if you were to view it on mobile it would look horrible. I mainly
used bootstrap for the layout, including the footer, header, and the columns for the About Me section and Homework Index.
